                      <li>As a team of four developers, we created iSongCollect, an electronic cloud-based AngularJS
                        web application to update pencil-and-paper song collections used in song collections for a
                        specific, niche type of music educators. We used AngularJS, Express.js, and Node.js for our
                        full-stack framework, Quill.js for content editing, Filestack to manage uploaded files, and
                        Bootstrap.</li>
                      <li>I built and debugged individual features like redirecting a user after login and
                        print styling, and I learned a great deal about the process of envisioning and constructing of
                        real-world full-stack software projects.</li>
