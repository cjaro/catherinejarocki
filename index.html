                                <p>Reporting directly to the CTO, I was responsible for developing and maintaining web applications, troubleshooting issues, and finding efficient ways to improve services. This entailed continuing to enhance and refine my

                                <p>I provided professional training and support directly to clients of varying sizes, demonstrating my knowledge of web development concepts, practices, and procedures including API integration, object oriented programming,

                                <p>I left Brandpoint with mixed feelings after the preceding departures of former employees left me with little work to do and a gap between my ability to meaningfully contribute and the abilities of the other developers on

                            <li>I studied at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University from August of 2012 to May of 2016, studying a variety of subjects across a liberal arts environment, included English, French, Sociology, Anthropology,
                                Physics, Biology, Microbiology, Biochemistry, Evolution, and my eprsonal favorite, The Biology and Natural History of Maple Syrup (yes, really). While at CSB/SJU, I participated on the cross counrty running team, the Nordic

                                    about breweries, location services, beer names & descriptions, and other neat components. I used Firebase to handle authentication, SQL for my database, Express.js for middleware functions, and Bootstrap & Sass for

                        <p>I am a full stack web developer with experience developing in JavaScript, PHP, and C#. I have worked with a wide variety of technologies and have learned valuable lessons in my career as both a contractor and full-time employee.
                            I am excited to continue learning as a developer and growing into my career wherever it takes me.</p>
                        <p>I have found boundless success working on teams that provide support, peer programming opportunities, and self-governing independence. I appreciate being able to ask my coworkers for help or advice when I'm out of ideas, but I
                            strongly value the skills I gain when I am forced or driven to hunt down solutions to my own tasks, problems, and questions. As a self-taught programmer with some formal education, I have been able to benefit from both guided
                            problem solving and independence.</p>
                        <p>I value clear expectations and boundaries of a job; I have experienced both desirable respect and great frustrations with this in the past, and I am always searching for a workplace where my career goals and desires (as they align
                            with the expectations of my job) are respected. I can't say I love a work environment where I'm forced to sandwich myself into a job that barely fits well instead of being able to thrive as a wholesome fit, valuable in my contributions
                            and encouraged to take on challenges that increase my worth to myself, my career, my coworkers, my employer, and my community.</p>
                        <p>I have explored, tested, and refined my personal ability to work remotely; coming from a freelancing past, I've had both successes and failures in this endeavor as I've tested services, methods, tools, and styles to make sure I'm
                            being as performant, effective, and communicative as possible. I have found that remote work has the potential to remove or minimize the standard distractions I've encountered in the traditional office place. I have found great
                            value in working on-site because I've learned to come out of my shell and ask questions while interacting with coworkers away from my keyboard; it's nice to have faces associated with the people I work with, and not just emails
                            or Slack messages. </p>
                        <p>Overall, whether I'm working remotely or onsite, I need to be treated as an adult who can self-govern and is trusted to get her shit done.</p>
