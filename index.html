                                <p>I am assisting in the direction of the modernization and optimization of the MN
                                    Ornithologists' Union's website (moumn.org). This is a vast project that requires
                                    analysis and understanding of the current system and data, use-cases, and design.
                                    Our intent is to incorporate modern and maintainable technologies and solid database
                                    design principles to accomplish the goal of this project. </p>
                                <p>From May-June 2021, we enlisted the invaluable services of the UX cohort at Prime
                                    Digital Academy, and they spent three weeks researching, interviewing, and
                                    consolidating insights, resources, and conclusions that they delivered at the
                                    conclusion of their capstone project. The students gave us resources and ideas to work with.</p>
